# NumericalCalculus
Code written for my Numerical Calculus classes

## Zero of Functions
On **ZeroOfFunction** are the codes for methodes for finding the zero of functions such as Newton's Method, Secant Method,
Bissection Method and False Position Method and a comparison between them.

## Least Squares
On**LeastSquares** and <mark>LeastSquaresScalable<\mark> is an implementation of the Least Squares method for any given degree along with and without
scaling the variable. The program also shows the conditioning of the linear system associated and plots the graph to every degree up to the desired degree:

## Non-linear Newton
On **NonLinear_Newton** is an implementation of Newton's Method for non-linear functions.

## Multiple Roots
On **MultipleRoots** there are implementations of variants of the Secants and Newton's Methods for functions with multiple roots and comparisons with the
regular methods.
